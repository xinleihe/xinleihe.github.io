Biography
======
I am an assistant professor jointly in the DSA and IoT Thrust of the Information Hub at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).
I am interested in Trustworthy Machine Learning, with a spesific focus on the security, privacy, and safety aspects.
Previously, I obtained my Ph.D at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.saarland/), Saarland University advised by Dr. [Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/) in 2023.
I received my bachelor (2017) and master (2020) degrees from Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/).
